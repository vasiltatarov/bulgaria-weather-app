# Weather Application Guide

âœ… **Core Functionality**
- Single Page Application (SPA)
- The app will consist of one main page with no routing or page navigation.

**Main Weather Display Card**
- A large, centered card that displays weather information.
- Should show current conditions, hourly forecast, and 7-day forecast.

**Top Navigation with Predefined Cities**
- 6 buttons displayed horizontally at the top of the screen.
- Each button represents a predefined city in Bulgaria: (location IDs)
  - Borovets
  - Bansko
  - Karlovo
  - Sofia
  - Plovdiv
  - Kardzhali
- When a button is clicked, the main weather card should update to show data for the selected city.

**Weather Data Source**
- Data is fetched from the Meteosource API (https://www.meteosource.com/documentation).
- Each city must use its appropriate API parameters (such as location ID, name, or coordinates, depending on API setup).

**Dynamic Weather Display**
On city selection:
- Display:
  - Current weather
  - Hourly forecast (e.g., next 12â€“24 hours)
  - 7-day forecast
- Weather info should include: temperature, condition/summary, wind speed/direction, humidity, and other relevant data.

ðŸ”§ **Tech Stack (recommended/defaults)**
- Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS (or plain CSS)
- State Management: `useState`, `useEffect` (or Zustand if needed)
- Data Fetching: Fetch API or Axios
- Environment Variables: API keys from Meteosource stored in `.env`

ðŸ“Œ **Design Hints**
- Use a clean, minimal design.
- Main weather card centered on the page.
- Highlight the selected city button visually.
- Make use of icons or background color changes to represent weather states if desired.
